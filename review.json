{"name": "Unameb", "date": "5 May 2019", "title": " Great ending but not as good as infinity war overall\n", "review": "Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this.", "rating": "8"},
